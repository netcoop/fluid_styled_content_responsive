# FLUID Styled Content Responsive

Experimental extension to make TEXTMEDIA rendering fully responsive, while retaining the options for using multiple images.

## First working version 0.0.1

Renders TEXTMEDIA completely responsive, but you have to set a fixed width ratio between
text and media, e.g. 50/50% or 40/60%. Images can be shown larger than the actual image
size, resulting in unsharp pictures (so make sure not to set too low values for size in
the image records).
